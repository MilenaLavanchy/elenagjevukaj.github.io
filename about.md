My place is where my heart belongs to and I'm excited to explore its lands and waters :)

Things which make me happy, that I can spend hours doing:
* exploring the diversity of functional areas, thus,  fostering a higher degree of technical and functional versatility, while refining a sense of relationship.
* comparing, contrasting, and combining creative ideas to develop insights and alternative possibilities

My main areas of expertise include UX/UI Design and Application Development, Application Support, Requirement management, Client Support and Problem Solving.

Also I am particularly interested in development of my public speaking skills at Toastmasters.
