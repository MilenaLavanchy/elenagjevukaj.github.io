I'm a junior web developer majoring in computer science. 

I have 3 years of experience with WordPress, Joomla, Shopify, Spree Commerce, and other platforms.

I have created over 30 websites, most of which required custom designed plugins, extensions, and themes

My aim has always been to produce websites that look beautiful and professional, are highly functional, load quickly, and are Search Engine optimized.
