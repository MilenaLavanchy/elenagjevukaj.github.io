## Typography Elements in One

<img src="\assets\images\IMG_20180306_183729.png">
A Bug Squashing Party is  a come-together (either virtual or real life) of Debian Developers and Debian enthusiasts on a specified timeframe where these persons try to fix as many bugs as possible.

In this event it was a large number of womens. There were like 90% of womens and I think if anyone saw us working together they would doubt that it was a tech event. 
As in other fields in general tech world is not an exeption when it comes for dicrimination and sexisem, 
but luckly for us in this event organized by our friend Daniel Pockock (from Debian)
and OpenLabs Tirana that wasn't our case. 

We were a large group of computer science, students and graduates coming from Kosovo. 
For me it was the first time in OpenLabs and I must say It was and amazing time meeting the organizers and members and working with them.

## Footnote

Let's say you have text that you want to refer with a footnote, you can do that too! This is an example for the footnote number one [[^1]]. You can even add more footnotes, with link! [[^2]]

## Blockquote

> Start by doing what's necessary; then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible. --Francis of Assisi

**NOTE:** This theme does NOT support nested blockquotes.

<div class="divider"></div>

## List Items

1. First order list item
2. Second item

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

<div class="divider"></div>

## Code Blocks

```javascript
var modularpattern = (function() {
    // your module code goes here
    var sum = 0 ;

    return {
        add:function() {
            sum = sum + 1;
            return sum;
        },
        reset:function() {
            return sum = 0;    
        }  
    }   
}());
alert(modularpattern.add());    // alerts: 1
alert(modularpattern.add());    // alerts: 2
alert(modularpattern.reset());  // alerts: 0
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

## Horizontal Line

The HTML `<hr>` element is for creating a "thematic break" between paragraph-level elements. In markdown, you can create a `<hr>` with any of the following:

* `___`: three consecutive underscores
* `---`: three consecutive dashes
* `***`: three consecutive asterisks

renders to:

___
