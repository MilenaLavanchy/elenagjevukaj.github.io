 A Bug Squashing Party is  a come-together (either virtual or real life) of 
Debian Developers and Debian enthusiasts on a specified timeframe where these persons try to fix as many bugs as possible.


In this event it was a large number of womens. There were like 90% of womens and I think if anyone saw us working together
 they would doubt that it was a tech event. 
As in other fields in general tech world is not an exeption when it comes for dicrimination and sexisem, 
but luckly for us in this event organized by our friend Daniel Pockock (from Debian)
and OpenLabs Tirana that wasn't our case. 

We were a large group of computer science, students and graduates coming from Kosovo. 
For me it was the first time in OpenLabs and I must say It was and amazing time meeting the organizers and members and working with them.
