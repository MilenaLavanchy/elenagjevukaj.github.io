I was part of CODERGALS in Prizren, a hackathon organized for the first time in my country. 

This event took place in the city of Prizren. As we entered the working place, we were given our ID cards, pen and a set of guidelines for the project. Then, we were welcomed by the organizers and mentors.

We brainstormed for about 3-4 hours to decide the project. We discussed many ideas that ranged from Doppler effect to GUI interfaces for phone calls. Finally we ended up making an project for linking the PC with your phone so it will ease the procedure not to use both when you need to add a contact, make a call or even sent text messages. As you can see from our work we ended up doing the most of our work and it was a double challenge for us because we worked on Debian OS.

CoderGals hackathon had whatever one would like to have in such an event, maybe more.
