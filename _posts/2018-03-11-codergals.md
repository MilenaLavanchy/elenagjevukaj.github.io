CODERGALS hackathon was organized for the first time in my country. This event took place in the beuatiful city of Prizren. 
CoderGals, an event held for 24 to 48 hours, was an idea which started from two girls majoring in Computer Science Qendresa and Albiona Hoti. 
Thanks to them, we had the chance to work on exciting projects as well as be mentored by key tech people including: Mergim Cahani, Daniel Pocock, Taulant Mehmeti, Mergim Krasniqi, Kolos Pukaj, Bujar Dervishaj, Arta Shehu Zaimi and Edon Bajrami.

We brainstormed for about 3-4 hours to decide for the project. We discussed many ideas that ranged from Doppler effect to GUI interfaces for phone calls. Finally we ended up making an project for linking the PC with your phone so it will ease the procedure not to use both when you need to add a contact, make a call or even sent text messages.
We called it Phone to Client project. 

You can check our work online:

It was a challenge for us because we worked for the first time on Debian OS.
